% Script specifying the camera and light parameters. Coordinate system is: 
% X-axis (left->right), Y-axis(bottom->top), Z-axis(in->out).
% Suppose the camera+light are on the Z-axis, looking towards the origin
% (inside the screen). Both the light source and the camera are assumed to
% be points (perspective projection). 
%
% Output are the structures Light and Camera. 
% 
% Fields of Light are Pos (position), I0 (strength), Freqs (frequencies), 
% Offsets (offsets), Amps (amplitudes). It is assumed that the phase of 
% each frequency is zero. 
% 
% Fields of Camera are Pos (position), LuxToPhoton (conversion factor
% between lux and photons), ExposureTime (seconds), ReadNoise (standard
% deviation in electrons), FullWellCap (electrons), CameraGain (number of
% photons per grey level), NumBits (bit-depth). Also, Freqs (frequencies), 
% Offsets (offsets), Amps (amplitudes) for the reference signal (using
% either electronics or external modulation).
